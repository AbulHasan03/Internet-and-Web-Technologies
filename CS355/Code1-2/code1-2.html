    <h1> Revelation </h1>
    <h2> by Robert Frost </h2>

    <p>
    We make ourselves a place apart
    <br  />
        &nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout, </nbsp>
        <br  />
    But oh, the agitated heart
    <br  />
        &nbsp; Till someone find us really out.
        <br  />
    </p>
    <p>
    'Tis pity if the case require
    <br  />
        &nbsp; (Or so we say) that in the end
        <br  />
    We speak the literal to inspire
    <br  />
        &nbsp; The understanding of a friend.
    
    </p>
    <p> 
    But so with all, from babes that play
    <br  />
        &nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar,
        <br  />
    So all who hide too well away
    <br  />
        &nbsp; Must speak and tell us there they are.
        <br  />
    </p>
